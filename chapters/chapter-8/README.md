# Chapter 8 - Terraform modularization (Modular Deployments)

## Goal

This chapter consists of 2 parts:

### Terraform Modules

The goal is to introduce the concept of modularization in Terraform. This is a key concept in Terraform that allows you to break down your infrastructure into smaller, reusable components.
In addition to this we will show Microsofts approach to modularization in Terraform by using the [Azure Verified modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/#:~:text=Azure%20Verified%20Modules%20%28AVM%29%20is%20an%20initiative%20to,and%20available%20from%20their%20respective%20language%20specific%20registries.).

### Lab: Build your own Terraform modules

The goal is to reflect on the previous chapters and apply the knowledge to create a modularized deployment.
