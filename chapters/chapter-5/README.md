## Goal

The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the basics of Terraform. 

In this chapter we will cover the following topics:

- IaC Overview
- Terraform Intro
- Providers & Multi-Providers
- Variables, Locals, Outputs
- Expressions & Functions
- State Management, Terraform Import & Workspace

In a further chapter we will dive into the topic of Terraform Modules in more detail.

> [!CAUTION] 
> For all the following topics there are slides available for the instructor (and these will be shared with the participants): https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/joergjo_microsoft_com/EeK5S2BZyuRFu1kN-t9ICuEBPcywO-wWjh9YcKepB9tEQQ?e=YQYUAp 

## IaC Overview

Objective: Understand the basic concept of IaC and its benefits.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Please use the chapter **"IaC Overview"** from the slides: https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/joergjo_microsoft_com/EeK5S2BZyuRFu1kN-t9ICuEBPcywO-wWjh9YcKepB9tEQQ?e=YQYUAp 

### Task 

Discuss the benefits of IaC with the participants and show a comparison between traditional infrastructure setup and IaC.

## Terraform Intro

> [!CAUTION]
>  Please use the chapter **"Terraform Intro"** from the slides: https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/joergjo_microsoft_com/EeK5S2BZyuRFu1kN-t9ICuEBPcywO-wWjh9YcKepB9tEQQ?e=YQYUAp 

Set up Terraform and understand its basic structure.

### Practical minimal example:

You can use [01_intro](../../solutions/chapter-5/01_intro) as a starting point for a very simple example and validation if your terraform and azure cli setup is working.

## Terraform Providers

> [!CAUTION] 
> Please use the chapter **"Terraform Providers"** from the slides: https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/joergjo_microsoft_com/EeK5S2BZyuRFu1kN-t9ICuEBPcywO-wWjh9YcKepB9tEQQ?e=YQYUAp

### Practical minimal example:

You can use [02_providers](../../solutions/chapter-5/02_providers) as a starting point for a very simple example to showcase multiple providers with aliases

## Terraform Variables, Locals and Outputs

> [!CAUTION]
>  Please use the chapter **"Terraform Variables, Locals and Outputs"** from the slides: https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/joergjo_microsoft_com/EeK5S2BZyuRFu1kN-t9ICuEBPcywO-wWjh9YcKepB9tEQQ?e=YQYUAp

### Practical minimal example:

You can use [03_variables](../../solutions/chapter-5/03_variables) as a starting point for a minimalistic example to showcase variables, locals and outputs.

## Terraform Expressions & Functions

> [!CAUTION]
> Please use the chapter **"Terraform Expressions & Functions"** from the slides: https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/joergjo_microsoft_com/EeK5S2BZyuRFu1kN-t9ICuEBPcywO-wWjh9YcKepB9tEQQ?e=YQYUAp

### Practical minimal example:

You can use [04_expressions](../../solutions/chapter-5/04_expressions) as a starting point for a minimalistic example to showcase expressions and functions.

## Terraform State Management, Terraform Import & Workspace

> [!CAUTION]
> Please use the chapter **"Terraform State Management, Terraform Import & Workspace"** from the slides: https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/joergjo_microsoft_com/EeK5S2BZyuRFu1kN-t9ICuEBPcywO-wWjh9YcKepB9tEQQ?e=YQYUAp

### Practical minimal example:

You can use [05_state](../../solutions/chapter-5/05_state) as a starting point for a minimalistic example to showcase state management, terraform import and workspace.
