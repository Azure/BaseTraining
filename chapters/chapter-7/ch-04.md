# 4 - Container Registry
You will soon create a Kubernete cluster, but a prerequisite for any container platform is a store for your container images - a registry. 

## Objectives
- Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Place the ACR in your existing resource group in Sweden Central.
- Randomize the registry's name the same way you have randomized your resource group's name.
- Use the `Basic` SKU.
- Disable admin access.

> The purpose of "disable admin access" is to disable traditional username/password based authentication. You will use Entra ID based access instead.

## Success Criteria
- The ACR is up and running.
- You can upload the test application's source code to the ACR and have it build a container image. 

### Verification
On your PowerShell terminal run the following command. Please use Azure Cloudshell if you are not able to connect ti ACR via Powershell.

```powershell
# Replace youracr with your registry's name 
az acr login -n "youracr" --expose-token
az acr build -r "youracr" -t go-probe:latest --platform linux/amd64 https://github.com/joergjo/go-probe.git
```

This step will pull down the source code of our test application into your registry and build a container image. The application will be used later throughout this lab for additional verification steps.

You can also check in the Azure portal whether your registry now contains a repository called `go-probe` that contains an image.
